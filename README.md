# DistributedSytems-Bulletin-Board-System-V1.0-
simulating a news bulletin board system. In this system there are several processes accessing the system, either getting the news from the system or updating the news. The system will consist of a server that implements the actual news bulletin board and several remote clients that communicate with the server using the TCP/IP protocol suite. The remote clients will have to communicate with the server to write their news to the bulletin board and also to read the news from the bulletin board.
